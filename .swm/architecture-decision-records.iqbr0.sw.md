<br/>

Changes the current turn in a two-player game.

@Override - This method overrides a parent class method.

public void `changeTurn()`<swm-token data-swm-token=":Generic-Board-Game-Design/game_list/tic_tac_toe/TicTacToe.java:111:5:7:`    public void changeTurn() {`"/> - The method signature, returns void and has no parameters.<br/>
`currentTurn`<swm-token data-swm-token=":Generic-Board-Game-Design/game_list/tic_tac_toe/TicTacToe.java:112:4:4:`        if (currentTurn == teamA[0]) {`"/> - The current player whose turn it is. This will be a reference to either `teamA[0]`<swm-token data-swm-token=":Generic-Board-Game-Design/game_list/tic_tac_toe/TicTacToe.java:112:8:11:`        if (currentTurn == teamA[0]) {`"/> or `teamB[0]`<swm-token data-swm-token=":Generic-Board-Game-Design/game_list/tic_tac_toe/TicTacToe.java:113:5:8:`            currentTurn = teamB[0];`"/>.<br/>
`teamA[0]`<swm-token data-swm-token=":Generic-Board-Game-Design/game_list/tic_tac_toe/TicTacToe.java:112:8:11:`        if (currentTurn == teamA[0]) {`"/> - The first player on team A.<br/>
`teamB[0]`<swm-token data-swm-token=":Generic-Board-Game-Design/game_list/tic_tac_toe/TicTacToe.java:113:5:8:`            currentTurn = teamB[0];`"/> - The first player on team B.<br/>

If the current turn belongs to the first player on team A,<br/>
this method will set the current turn to the first player on team B.<br/>
Otherwise, it will set the current turn to the first player on team A.<br/>
This method simply alternates the current turn between the two teams<br/>
on each call.
